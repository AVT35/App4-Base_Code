Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of the code is for the user to be able to document whether the symptoms he/she is experiencing is a cold or an allergy. Based on user responses, the code calculates the probability that the user symptoms are that of a cold or an allergy. 
 
Known Issues:
The buttons were difficult to code for. I had trouble getting the buttons to indicate the pages should change, and the code ended up being a list format for a while.
